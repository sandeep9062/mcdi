## Introduction

Periodontology is the branch of dentistry concerned with the supporting structures of teeth, including the gums, periodontal ligament, alveolar bone, and cementum. Periodontal diseases are among the most common diseases affecting humans.

## Periodontal Anatomy

### Gingiva
- **Free Gingiva**: Marginal tissue not attached to tooth
- **Attached Gingiva**: Firmly attached to underlying bone
- **Interdental Gingiva**: Located between teeth

### Periodontal Ligament
- Connective tissue fibers attaching tooth to bone
- Contains blood vessels, nerves, and cells
- Functions in tooth support, nutrition, and sensation

- Bony socket housing tooth roots
- Contains bundle bone and alveolar proper
- Undergoes continuous remodeling

## Periodontal Diseases

### Gingivitis
- Inflammation of gingiva only
- Reversible with proper oral hygiene
- Caused by dental plaque accumulation

### Periodontitis
- Inflammation extending to supporting structures
- Irreversible attachment loss
- Can lead to tooth loss if untreated

### Classification
- **Chronic Periodontitis**: Most common form
- **Aggressive Periodontitis**: Rapid progression
- **Necrotizing Periodontal Diseases**: Associated with systemic conditions

## Risk Factors

### Local Factors
- Poor oral hygiene
- Dental plaque and calculus
- Malocclusion
